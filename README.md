# Image-Filter-Processing
The program takes an image as an input and outputs a greyscale image.

## The Program
Uses the idea of convolution filters and sobel edge detection to find edges and parts of an image. A filter is run horizontally and vertically. Both gradients are then combined. These pixels are then plotted to produce a new image. The input image can be RGB. The output image will be 2 pixels less in height and width compared to the input image due to the convolution filters. Can take a .png or .jpeg/jpg file and will always produce a .jpeg/jpg file.
